    <p>
      This program shows in console all the indicators from the Indicators API
      of the World Bank that have data available for China.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a problem with this API. It has 17494 indicators, but many of them
      do not work because they don't have data.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, I decided to create this program that would return an
      array with all the indicators that have data for a well studied country by
      the World Bank, i.e., China.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elements of the array are objects with two properties: id and name of
      the indicator.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big problem with this program is that it requires a lot of resources
      since it makes almost 20 thousand fetches.
